# Pythagorean Theorem

## Introduction

The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.

## Mathematical Formula

The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b, and c:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Where:
- a and b are the lengths of the two legs (the sides that form the right angle)
- c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite to the right angle)

## Example

Consider a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4:

- a = 3
- b = 4
- c = ?

Using the formula:
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2
9 + 16 = c^2
25 = c^2
c = 5

This is the famous 3-4-5 right triangle.

## Visual Representation

A visual representation would show:
1. A right triangle with the right angle clearly marked
2. Squares constructed on each side of the triangle
3. Labels showing that the area of the large square equals the sum of the two smaller squares

## Applications

The Pythagorean theorem is used in:
- Architecture and construction
- Navigation and GPS
- Computer graphics
- Physics calculations
- Engineering design
